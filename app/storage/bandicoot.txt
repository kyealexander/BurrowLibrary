Title: The Southern Brown Bandicoot
Scientific Name: Isoodon obesulus

The bandicoot is a small, nocturnal marsupial that digs cone-shaped holes in search of worms, grubs, and fungi.
Its burrowing helps aerate soil and spread plant seeds, making it an important little gardener of the bush.

Fun Facts:
- Bandicoots can produce a litter of young in just 12 days — the shortest mammal gestation period in the world.
- Their hind feet are fused for grooming, like a kangaroo's.
- They often share burrows or reuse those made by other animals.
