Title: The Short-Beaked Echidna
Scientific Name: Tachyglossus aculeatus

The echidna is one of Australia's most unique creatures — a monotreme, meaning it lays eggs despite being a mammal! 
It uses its long, sticky tongue to feast on ants and termites, and digs deep burrows to escape the heat or hide from predators.

Fun Facts:
- Echidnas have electroreceptors on their snouts to detect prey underground.
- Each echidna has over 2,000 spines for protection.
- The echidna and platypus are the only egg-laying mammals on Earth.
