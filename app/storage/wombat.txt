Title: The Common Wombat
Scientific Name: Vombatus ursinus

The wombat is Australia’s master burrow engineer. Its tunnels can stretch up to 30 meters long and 3 meters deep!
Though usually solitary, wombats sometimes share burrows in harsh weather.

Fun Facts:
- Wombats produce cube-shaped droppings to mark territory without them rolling away.
- Their burrow systems are so strong they can collapse on predators — and even resist bushfires.
- Some say one very noisy echidna has borrowed a wombat burrow to hide something secret...
